                        A web developer or programmer is someone who takes a web 
                        design – which has been created by either a client or a design team – and 
                        turns it into a website. They do this by writing lines and lines of complicated code, 
                        using a variety of languages. Web developers have quite a difficult job, because 
                        they essentially have to take a language we understand, such as English, and 
                        translate it into a language that a computer understands, such as Python or HTML.

                        A programmer works according to the specifications provided by a systems analyst 
                        or senior programmer. After completing a program design, a programmer converts 
                        the design into a series of codes or instructions that the computer can run and 
                        execute, making use of a specific programming language and required platforms. 
                        After converting the design to code, a programmer runs the code and looks for 
                        bugs and errors. If a programmer finds code errors, appropriate corrections are 
                        applied, and the program is re-run. The programmer tries to perfect the code 
                        through a process of trial and error until reaching an acceptable error level and 
                        continues this process throughout the life of a program, as software and programs 
                        are never truly perfect or finished.

                        Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. 
                        It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. 
                        The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided 
                        into a few common categories.
